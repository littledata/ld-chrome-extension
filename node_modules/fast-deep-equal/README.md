## Install

```bash
npm install fast-deep-equal
```


## Features

- ES5 compatible
<<<<<<< HEAD
- works in node.js (8+) and browsers (IE9+)
- checks equality of Date and RegExp objects by value.

ES6 equal (`require('fast-deep-equal/es6')`) also supports:
- Maps
- Sets
- Typed arrays

=======
- works in node.js (0.10+) and browsers (IE9+)
- checks equality of Date and RegExp objects by value.

## Usage

```javascript
var equal = require('fast-deep-equal');
console.log(equal({foo: 'bar'}, {foo: 'bar'})); // true
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
To support ES6 Maps, Sets and Typed arrays equality use:

```javascript
var equal = require('fast-deep-equal/es6');
console.log(equal(Int16Array([1, 2]), Int16Array([1, 2]))); // true
```

To use with React (avoiding the traversal of React elements' _owner
property that contains circular references and is not needed when
comparing the elements - borrowed from [react-fast-compare](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-fast-compare)):

```javascript
var equal = require('fast-deep-equal/react');
var equal = require('fast-deep-equal/es6/react');
```
