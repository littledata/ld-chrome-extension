ESLint couldn't find the plugin "<%- pluginName %>".

(The package "<%- pluginName %>" was not found when loaded as a Node module from the directory "<%- resolvePluginsRelativeTo %>".)

It's likely that the plugin isn't installed correctly. Try reinstalling by running the following:

    npm install <%- pluginName %>@latest --save-dev

The plugin "<%- pluginName %>" was referenced from the config file in "<%- importerName %>".

If you still can't figure out the problem, please stop by https://eslint.org/chat/help to chat with the team.
=======
ESLint couldn't find the plugin "<%- pluginName %>". This can happen for a couple different reasons:

1. If ESLint is installed globally, then make sure <%- pluginName %> is also installed globally. A globally-installed ESLint cannot find a locally-installed plugin.

2. If ESLint is installed locally, then it's likely that the plugin isn't installed correctly. Try reinstalling by running the following:

    npm i <%- pluginName %>@latest --save-dev
